# Si1ver's Script Stash

This repository contains an assortment of small utility shell scripts (currently CMD only) that I use in my development process.

I was tired of losing and rewriting them every time, so now I'm storing them in this repo.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are written for my own custom needs and may not be suitable for everyone. They may contain bugs or unexpected behavior.

Use them at your own risk. I am not responsible for any issues or damage that may result from their use.
